# Gaelan Steele
Hi! I'm Gaelan Steele, a undergraduate computer science student at the [University of St Andrews][sta].
My interests include web development, systems programming, and reverse engineering.
I'm also passionate about social justice and equality; nothing we do exists in a vacuum.
In the past, I've worked as an intern at the [Peninsula School District][psd] and contributed to [ResistBot][resistbot] and [Nixpkgs][nixpkgs].
I currently have <a href="http://tabs.gaelan.me" id="tabs"></a> browser tabs open.
